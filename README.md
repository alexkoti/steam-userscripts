# Steam Userscripts Collection
Tampermonkey userscripts :D
These scripts are intended to assist navigation in the Steam store and other related sites (SteamDB, ITAD, etc.). The main feature is to hide ignored games and flag the games you already own or are on your steam wishlist.

All scripts rely on access to your userdata json on Steam, located at https://store.steampowered.com/dynamicstore/userdata/, so you must be logged in your Steam account. If any script dont works as expected, try access the json in your browser and reload the page.
